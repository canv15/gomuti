**WARNING:** Experimental code; master branch may break compatibility. Please see [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for information on planned changes.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xeger/gomuti.png)](https://travis-ci.org/xeger/gomuti)

Gomuti is DSL for [mocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) Golang interfaces, heavily inspired by [Gomega](https://github.com/onsi/gomega) and [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo).

Although you can use it directly to build mock types by hand, it is intended to be used with [Mongoose](https://github.com/xeger/mongoose), which saves substantial manual effort by automatically generating a mock type for every interface in your package.

## How to use

TODO - explain how to use gomuti. For basic examples, please see [mongoose](https://github.com/xeger/mongoose).
